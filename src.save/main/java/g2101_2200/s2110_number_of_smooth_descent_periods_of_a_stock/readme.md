2110\. Number of Smooth Descent Periods of a Stock

Medium

You are given an integer array `prices` representing the daily price history of a stock, where `prices[i]` is the stock price on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> day.

A **smooth descent period** of a stock consists of **one or more contiguous** days such that the price on each day is **lower** than the price on the **preceding day** by **exactly** `1`. The first day of the period is exempted from this rule.

Return _the number of **smooth descent periods**_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = [3,2,1,4]

**Output:** 7

**Explanation:** There are 7 smooth descent periods: 

[3], [2], [1], [4], [3,2], [2,1], and [3,2,1] 

Note that a period with one day is a smooth descent period by the definition.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = [8,6,7,7]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** There are 4 smooth descent periods: [8], [6], [7], and [7] 

Note that [8,6] is not a smooth descent period as 8 - 6 â‰  1.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** prices = [1]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** There is 1 smooth descent period: [1]

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= prices.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   <code>1 <= prices[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
