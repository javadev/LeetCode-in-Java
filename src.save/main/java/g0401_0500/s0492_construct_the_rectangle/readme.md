492\. Construct the Rectangle

Easy

A web developer needs to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:

1.  The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
2.  The width `W` should not be larger than the length `L`, which means `L >= W`.
3.  The difference between length `L` and width `W` should be as small as possible.

Return _an array `[L, W]` where `L` and `W` are the length and width of the web page you designed in sequence._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** area = 4

**Output:** [2,2]

**Explanation:** The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3, [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** area = 37

**Output:** [37,1]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** area = 122122

**Output:** [427,286]

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= area <= 10<sup>7</sup></code>
