2948\. Make Lexicographically Smallest Array by Swapping Elements

Medium

You are given a **0-indexed** array of **positive** integers `nums` and a **positive** integer `limit`.

In one operation, you can choose any two indices `i` and `j` and swap `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` **if** `|nums[i] - nums[j]| <= limit`.

Return _the **lexicographically smallest array** that can be obtained by performing the operation any number of times_.

An array `a` is lexicographically smaller than an array `b` if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, array `a` has an element that is less than the corresponding element in `b`. For example, the array `[2,10,3]` is lexicographically smaller than the array `[10,2,3]` because they differ at index `0` and `2 < 10`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,5,3,9,8], limit = 2

**Output:** [1,3,5,8,9]

**Explanation:** Apply the operation 2 times:

- Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. The array becomes [1,3,5,9,8]

- Swap nums[3] with nums[4]. The array becomes [1,3,5,8,9]

We cannot obtain a lexicographically smaller array by applying any more operations.

Note that it may be possible to get the same result by doing different operations.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,7,6,18,2,1], limit = 3

**Output:** [1,6,7,18,1,2]

**Explanation:** Apply the operation 3 times:

- Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. The array becomes [1,6,7,18,2,1]

- Swap nums[0] with nums[4]. The array becomes [2,6,7,18,1,1]

- Swap nums[0] with nums[5]. The array becomes [1,6,7,18,1,2]

We cannot obtain a lexicographically smaller array by applying any more operations.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1,7,28,19,10], limit = 3

**Output:** [1,7,28,19,10]

**Explanation:** [1,7,28,19,10] is the lexicographically smallest array we can obtain because we cannot apply the operation on any two indices.

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   <code>1 <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>
*   <code>1 <= limit <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>
