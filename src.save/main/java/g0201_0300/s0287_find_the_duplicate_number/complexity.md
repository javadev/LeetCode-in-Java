**Time Complexity (Big O Time):**

The time complexity of this program is O(n), where 'n' is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because the program iterates through the entire array exactly once in a single pass. In the worst case, it might need to iterate through the entire array to find the duplicate.

**Space Complexity (Big O Space):**

The space complexity of the program is O(n), where 'n' is the length of the input array `nums`. The program creates an integer array `arr` of size `nums.length + 1`, which requires additional space. The size of this array is directly proportional to the size of the input array `nums`.

In summary, the provided program has a time complexity of O(n), where 'n' is the length of the input array `nums`, and it has a space complexity of O(n), indicating linear space usage.
