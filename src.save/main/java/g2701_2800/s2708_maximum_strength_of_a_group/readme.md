2708\. Maximum Strength of a Group

Medium

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` representing the score of students in an exam. The teacher would like to form one **non-empty** group of students with maximal **strength**, where the strength of a group of students of indices <code>i<sub>0</sub></code>, <code>i<sub>1</sub></code>, <code>i<sub>2</sub></code>, ... , <code>i<sub>k</sub></code> is defined as <code>nums[i<sub>0</sub>] * nums[i<sub>1</sub>] * nums[i<sub>2</sub>] * ... * nums[i<sub>k</sub>]</code>.

Return _the maximum strength of a group the teacher can create_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [3,-1,-5,2,5,-9]

**Output:** 1350

**Explanation:** One way to form a group of maximal strength is to group the students at indices [0,2,3,4,5]. Their strength is 3 \* (-5) \* 2 \* 5 \* (-9) = 1350, which we can show is optimal.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [-4,-5,-4]

**Output:** 20

**Explanation:** Group the students at indices [0, 1] . Then, weâ€™ll have a resulting strength of 20. We cannot achieve greater strength.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 13`
*   `-9 <= nums[i] <= 9`
