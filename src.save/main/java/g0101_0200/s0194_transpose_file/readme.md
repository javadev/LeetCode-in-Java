194\. Transpose File

Medium

Given a text file `file.txt`, transpose its content.

You may assume that each row has the same number of columns, and each field is separated by the `' '` character.

**Example:**

If `file.txt` has the following content:

    name age
    alice 21
    ryan 30 

Output the following:

    name alice ryan
    age 21 30
