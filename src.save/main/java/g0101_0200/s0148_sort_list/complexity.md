**Time Complexity (Big O Time):**

The time complexity of the `sortList` method in this program is O(N*log(N)), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. Here's the breakdown:

- The recursive `sortList` function divides the linked list into two halves. This division step is performed in O(N/2) time, and it happens recursively, so it results in O(N*log(N)) time complexity.
- The merging step, where the two sorted halves are merged together, takes O(N) time in each recursive call.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the `sortList` method is O(N*log(N)).

**Space Complexity (Big O Space):**

The space complexity of the `sortList` method is O(log(N)) on average due to the recursive function calls. This is because the space required for the function call stack during the recursion grows logarithmically with the number of elements in the list. Each recursive call creates a new stack frame with its own local variables.

Additionally, the program uses a few extra variables for pointers and a dummy node (`res`). These variables consume a constant amount of space, so they don't significantly affect the overall space complexity.

In summary, the primary space consumption is due to the recursion stack, resulting in an average space complexity of O(log(N)) for this program.
