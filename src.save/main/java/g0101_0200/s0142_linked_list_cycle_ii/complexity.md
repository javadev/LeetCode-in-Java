**Time Complexity (Big O Time):**

- The program uses two pointers, `fast` and `slow`, to traverse the linked list.
- The first while loop is used to determine if there is a cycle and find the meeting point of `fast` and `slow`. This loop runs until `fast` and `slow` meet inside the loop or reach the end of the list.

If there is no cycle, both pointers will reach the end of the list in O(N) time, where N is the number of nodes in the linked list.

If there is a cycle, the `fast` and `slow` pointers will meet inside the loop. The maximum number of iterations needed to detect the cycle and find the meeting point is less than or equal to N. Therefore, the time complexity remains O(N).

The second while loop is used to find the starting node of the cycle. It starts from the head of the list and moves `slow` and `fast` pointers at the same speed until they meet at the starting node of the cycle. This loop runs in O(N) time.

Overall, the time complexity of this algorithm is O(N).

**Space Complexity (Big O Space):**

The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1), which means it uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the size of the input linked list. It only uses a few additional pointers (`fast` and `slow`) to traverse the list and does not rely on additional data structures or recursion that would consume additional memory.

In summary, the time complexity of this program is O(N), and the space complexity is O(1), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list.
