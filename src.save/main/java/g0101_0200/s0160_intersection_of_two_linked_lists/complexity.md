**Time Complexity (Big O Time):**

The time complexity of this program is O(M + N), where M is the length of the first linked list (headA) and N is the length of the second linked list (headB). Here's why:

- The two pointers `node1` and `node2` traverse their respective linked lists until they either meet at the intersection or reach the end of their lists.
- In the worst case, where there is no intersection, both `node1` and `node2` will traverse both linked lists completely.
- Therefore, each of the two pointers will perform a total of M + N operations (M for the first list and N for the second list).

The program terminates as soon as `node1` and `node2` meet or both become null.

**Space Complexity (Big O Space):**

The space complexity of this program is O(1), which means it uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the size of the linked lists. The program only uses a fixed number of pointers (`node1`, `node2`) and variables to keep track of the intersection point.

In summary, the time complexity is O(M + N) where M and N are the lengths of the two linked lists, and the space complexity is O(1), indicating a constant amount of additional memory usage.
