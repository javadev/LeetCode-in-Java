2455\. Average Value of Even Numbers That Are Divisible by Three

Easy

Given an integer array `nums` of **positive** integers, return _the average value of all even integers that are divisible by_ `3`_._

Note that the **average** of `n` elements is the **sum** of the `n` elements divided by `n` and **rounded down** to the nearest integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,3,6,10,12,15]

**Output:** 9

**Explanation:** 6 and 12 are even numbers that are divisible by 3. (6 + 12) / 2 = 9.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,4,7,10]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** There is no single number that satisfies the requirement, so return 0.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
