1009\. Complement of Base 10 Integer

Easy

The **complement** of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the `0`'s to `1`'s and all the `1`'s to `0`'s in its binary representation.

*   For example, The integer `5` is `"101"` in binary and its **complement** is `"010"` which is the integer `2`.

Given an integer `n`, return _its complement_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** 5 is "101" in binary, with complement "010" in binary, which is 2 in base-10.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 7

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** 7 is "111" in binary, with complement "000" in binary, which is 0 in base-10.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 10

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** 10 is "1010" in binary, with complement "0101" in binary, which is 5 in base-10.

**Constraints:**

*   <code>0 <= n < 10<sup>9</sup></code>
