**Time Complexity (Big O Time):**

The time complexity of this program is O(n), where "n" represents the length of the input string `s`. Here's the breakdown:

1. The program first creates a new string `newStr` by inserting '#' characters between each character in the original string `s`. This operation has a time complexity of O(n) because it processes each character of `s`.

2. After creating `newStr`, the program uses the Manacher's Algorithm to find the longest palindromic substring. This algorithm is known to have a linear time complexity of O(n).

3. The loop that implements Manacher's Algorithm iterates through the characters of `newStr`. In each iteration, it performs constant-time operations like comparisons and arithmetic calculations. The key operation within this loop is the palindrome expansion, which extends the palindrome around the current center. The loop iterates through `newStr` only once, and each expansion step performs constant work.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the program is dominated by the linear-time Manacher's Algorithm, making it O(n).

**Space Complexity (Big O Space):**

The space complexity of this program is O(n), where "n" represents the length of the input string `s`. Here's why:

1. The program creates a new character array `newStr` with a length of `s.length() * 2 + 1`. This array stores a modified version of the input string `s` with '#' characters inserted. The space used by `newStr` is proportional to the length of `s`, so it has a space complexity of O(n).

2. The program uses an integer array `dp` of the same length as `newStr` to store information about the lengths of palindromes centered at different positions. The space complexity of `dp` is also O(n).

3. The program uses several integer variables (`friendCenter`, `friendRadius`, `lpsCenter`, and `lpsRadius`) to keep track of information during the algorithm. These variables take up constant space.

Therefore, the overall space complexity is dominated by the space used for `newStr` and `dp`, both of which are O(n).
