**Time Complexity (Big O Time):**

The time complexity of this program is O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of the input linked lists `l1` and `l2`. This is because the program iterates through both lists once, and the time complexity of each iteration is linear in the size of the input lists. In each iteration, it compares the values of the current nodes from `l1` and `l2` and adds the smaller value to the merged list. The loop will run until both `l1` and `l2` reach the end of their respective lists.

**Space Complexity (Big O Space):**

The space complexity of this program is O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of the input linked lists `l1` and `l2`. This space is mainly used for creating a new linked list that stores the merged result. In each iteration of the loop, a new node is created for the merged list, which consumes additional space. The space complexity is directly proportional to the size of the input lists because the merged list will have m + n nodes in the worst case.

Overall, the time and space complexity of the provided Java program is O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of the input linked lists `l1` and `l2`.
