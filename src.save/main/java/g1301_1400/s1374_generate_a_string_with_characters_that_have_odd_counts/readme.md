1374\. Generate a String With Characters That Have Odd Counts

Easy

Given an integer `n`, _return a string with `n` characters such that each character in such string occurs **an odd number of times**_.

The returned string must contain only lowercase English letters. If there are multiples valid strings, return **any** of them.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4

**Output:** "pppz"

**Explanation:** "pppz" is a valid string since the character 'p' occurs three times and the character 'z' occurs once. Note that there are many other valid strings such as "ohhh" and "love".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 2

**Output:** "xy"

**Explanation:** "xy" is a valid string since the characters 'x' and 'y' occur once. Note that there are many other valid strings such as "ag" and "ur".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 7

**Output:** "holasss"

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 500`
