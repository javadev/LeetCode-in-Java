1945\. Sum of Digits of String After Convert

Easy

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, and an integer `k`.

First, **convert** `s` into an integer by replacing each letter with its position in the alphabet (i.e., replace `'a'` with `1`, `'b'` with `2`, ..., `'z'` with `26`). Then, **transform** the integer by replacing it with the **sum of its digits**. Repeat the **transform** operation `k` **times** in total.

For example, if `s = "zbax"` and `k = 2`, then the resulting integer would be `8` by the following operations:

*   **Convert**: `"zbax" ➝ "(26)(2)(1)(24)" ➝ "262124" ➝ 262124`
*   **Transform #1**: `262124 ➝ 2 + 6 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 ➝ 17`
*   **Transform #2**: `17 ➝ 1 + 7 ➝ 8`

Return _the resulting integer after performing the operations described above_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "iiii", k = 1

**Output:** 36

**Explanation:** The operations are as follows: 

- Convert: "iiii" ➝ "(9)(9)(9)(9)" ➝ "9999" ➝ 9999 

- Transform #1: 9999 ➝ 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 ➝ 36 Thus the resulting integer is 36.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "leetcode", k = 2

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:** The operations are as follows: 

- Convert: "leetcode" ➝ "(12)(5)(5)(20)(3)(15)(4)(5)" ➝ "12552031545" ➝ 12552031545 

- Transform #1: 12552031545 ➝ 1 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 2 + 0 + 3 + 1 + 5 + 4 + 5 ➝ 33 

- Transform #2: 33 ➝ 3 + 3 ➝ 6 Thus the resulting integer is 6.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "zbax", k = 2

**Output:** 8

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 100`
*   `1 <= k <= 10`
*   `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
