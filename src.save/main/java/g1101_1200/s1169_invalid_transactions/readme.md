1169\. Invalid Transactions

Medium

A transaction is possibly invalid if:

*   the amount exceeds `$1000`, or;
*   if it occurs within (and including) `60` minutes of another transaction with the **same name** in a **different city**.

You are given an array of strings `transaction` where `transactions[i]` consists of comma-separated values representing the name, time (in minutes), amount, and city of the transaction.

Return a list of `transactions` that are possibly invalid. You may return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** transactions = ["alice,20,800,mtv","alice,50,100,beijing"]

**Output:** ["alice,20,800,mtv","alice,50,100,beijing"]

**Explanation:** The first transaction is invalid because the second transaction occurs within a difference of 60 minutes, have the same name and is in a different city. Similarly the second one is invalid too.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** transactions = ["alice,20,800,mtv","alice,50,1200,mtv"]

**Output:** ["alice,50,1200,mtv"]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** transactions = ["alice,20,800,mtv","bob,50,1200,mtv"]

**Output:** ["bob,50,1200,mtv"]

**Constraints:**

*   `transactions.length <= 1000`
*   Each `transactions[i]` takes the form `"{name},{time},{amount},{city}"`
*   Each `{name}` and `{city}` consist of lowercase English letters, and have lengths between `1` and `10`.
*   Each `{time}` consist of digits, and represent an integer between `0` and `1000`.
*   Each `{amount}` consist of digits, and represent an integer between `0` and `2000`.
