1116\. Print Zero Even Odd

Medium

You have a function `printNumber` that can be called with an integer parameter and prints it to the console.

*   For example, calling `printNumber(7)` prints `7` to the console.

You are given an instance of the class `ZeroEvenOdd` that has three functions: `zero`, `even`, and `odd`. The same instance of `ZeroEvenOdd` will be passed to three different threads:

*   **Thread A:** calls `zero()` that should only output `0`'s.
*   **Thread B:** calls `even()` that should only output even numbers.
*   **Thread C:** calls `odd()` that should only output odd numbers.

Modify the given class to output the series `"010203040506..."` where the length of the series must be `2n`.

Implement the `ZeroEvenOdd` class:

*   `ZeroEvenOdd(int n)` Initializes the object with the number `n` that represents the numbers that should be printed.
*   `void zero(printNumber)` Calls `printNumber` to output one zero.
*   `void even(printNumber)` Calls `printNumber` to output one even number.
*   `void odd(printNumber)` Calls `printNumber` to output one odd number.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2

**Output:** "0102"

**Explanation:** There are three threads being fired asynchronously. One of them calls zero(), the other calls even(), and the last one calls odd(). "0102" is the correct output.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 5

**Output:** "0102030405"

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 1000`
