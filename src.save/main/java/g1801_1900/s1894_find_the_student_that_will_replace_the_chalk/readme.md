1894\. Find the Student that Will Replace the Chalk

Medium

There are `n` students in a class numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. The teacher will give each student a problem starting with the student number `0`, then the student number `1`, and so on until the teacher reaches the student number `n - 1`. After that, the teacher will restart the process, starting with the student number `0` again.

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `chalk` and an integer `k`. There are initially `k` pieces of chalk. When the student number `i` is given a problem to solve, they will use `chalk[i]` pieces of chalk to solve that problem. However, if the current number of chalk pieces is **strictly less** than `chalk[i]`, then the student number `i` will be asked to **replace** the chalk.

Return _the **index** of the student that will **replace** the chalk_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** chalk = [5,1,5], k = 22

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** The students go in turns as follows:

- Student number 0 uses 5 chalk, so k = 17.

- Student number 1 uses 1 chalk, so k = 16.

- Student number 2 uses 5 chalk, so k = 11.

- Student number 0 uses 5 chalk, so k = 6.

- Student number 1 uses 1 chalk, so k = 5.

- Student number 2 uses 5 chalk, so k = 0.

Student number 0 does not have enough chalk, so they will have to replace it.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** chalk = [3,4,1,2], k = 25

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** The students go in turns as follows:

- Student number 0 uses 3 chalk so k = 22.

- Student number 1 uses 4 chalk so k = 18.

- Student number 2 uses 1 chalk so k = 17.

- Student number 3 uses 2 chalk so k = 15.

- Student number 0 uses 3 chalk so k = 12.

- Student number 1 uses 4 chalk so k = 8.

- Student number 2 uses 1 chalk so k = 7.

- Student number 3 uses 2 chalk so k = 5.

- Student number 0 uses 3 chalk so k = 2.

Student number 1 does not have enough chalk, so they will have to replace it. 

**Constraints:**

*   `chalk.length == n`
*   <code>1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   <code>1 <= chalk[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   <code>1 <= k <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>
