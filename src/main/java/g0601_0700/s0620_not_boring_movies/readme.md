620\. Not Boring Movies

Easy

SQL Schema

Table: `Cinema`

    +----------------+----------+
    | Column Name    | Type     |
    +----------------+----------+
    | id             | int      |
    | movie          | varchar  |
    | description    | varchar  |
    | rating         | float    |
    +----------------+----------+
    id is the primary key for this table.
    Each row contains information about the name of a movie, its genre, and its rating.
    rating is a 2 decimal places float in the range [0, 10] 

Write an SQL query to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not `"boring"`.

Return the result table ordered by `rating` **in descending order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**
    Cinema table:
    +----+------------+-------------+--------+
    | id | movie      | description | rating |
    +----+------------+-------------+--------+
    | 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
    | 2  | Science    | fiction     | 8.5    |
    | 3  | irish      | boring      | 6.2    |
    | 4  | Ice song   | Fantacy     | 8.6    |
    | 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
    +----+------------+-------------+--------+

**Output:**

    +----+------------+-------------+--------+
    | id | movie      | description | rating |
    +----+------------+-------------+--------+
    | 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
    | 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
    +----+------------+-------------+--------+

**Explanation:**

    We have three movies with odd-numbered IDs: 1, 3, and 5. The movie with ID = 3 is boring so we do not
    include it in the answer.
