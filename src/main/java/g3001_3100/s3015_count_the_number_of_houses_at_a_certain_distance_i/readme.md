3015\. Count the Number of Houses at a Certain Distance I

Medium

You are given three **positive** integers `n`, `x`, and `y`.

In a city, there exist houses numbered `1` to `n` connected by `n` streets. There is a street connecting the house numbered `i` with the house numbered `i + 1` for all `1 <= i <= n - 1` . An additional street connects the house numbered `x` with the house numbered `y`.

For each `k`, such that `1 <= k <= n`, you need to find the number of **pairs of houses** <code>(house<sub>1</sub>, house<sub>2</sub>)</code> such that the **minimum** number of streets that need to be traveled to reach <code>house<sub>2</sub></code> from <code>house<sub>1</sub></code> is `k`.

Return _a **1-indexed** array_ `result` _of length_ `n` _where_ `result[k]` _represents the **total** number of pairs of houses such that the **minimum** streets required to reach one house from the other is_ `k`.

**Note** that `x` and `y` can be **equal**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3, x = 1, y = 3

**Output:** [6,0,0]

**Explanation:** Let's look at each pair of houses: 
- For the pair (1, 2), we can go from house 1 to house 2 directly. 
- For the pair (2, 1), we can go from house 2 to house 1 directly. 
- For the pair (1, 3), we can go from house 1 to house 3 directly. 
- For the pair (3, 1), we can go from house 3 to house 1 directly. 
- For the pair (2, 3), we can go from house 2 to house 3 directly. 
- For the pair (3, 2), we can go from house 3 to house 2 directly.

**Input:** n = 5, x = 2, y = 4

**Output:** [10,8,2,0,0]

**Explanation:** For each distance k the pairs are: 
- For k == 1, the pairs are (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5), and (5, 4). 
- For k == 2, the pairs are (1, 3), (3, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (2, 5), (5, 2), (3, 5), and (5, 3). 
- For k == 3, the pairs are (1, 5), and (5, 1). 
- For k == 4 and k == 5, there are no pairs.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 4, x = 1, y = 1

**Output:** [6,4,2,0]

**Explanation:** For each distance k the pairs are: 
- For k == 1, the pairs are (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), and (4, 3). 
- For k == 2, the pairs are (1, 3), (3, 1), (2, 4), and (4, 2). 
- For k == 3, the pairs are (1, 4), and (4, 1). 
- For k == 4, there are no pairs.

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= n <= 100`
*   `1 <= x, y <= n`
