3014\. Minimum Number of Pushes to Type Word I

Easy

You are given a string `word` containing **distinct** lowercase English letters.

Telephone keypads have keys mapped with **distinct** collections of lowercase English letters, which can be used to form words by pushing them. For example, the key `2` is mapped with `["a","b","c"]`, we need to push the key one time to type `"a"`, two times to type `"b"`, and three times to type `"c"` _._

It is allowed to remap the keys numbered `2` to `9` to **distinct** collections of letters. The keys can be remapped to **any** amount of letters, but each letter **must** be mapped to **exactly** one key. You need to find the **minimum** number of times the keys will be pushed to type the string `word`.

Return _the **minimum** number of pushes needed to type_ `word` _after remapping the keys_.

An example mapping of letters to keys on a telephone keypad is given below. Note that `1`, `*`, `#`, and `0` do **not** map to any letters.

**Example 1:**

![](https://leetcode-in-java.github.io/src/main/java/g3001_3100/s3014_minimum_number_of_pushes_to_type_word_i/keypadv1e1.png)

**Input:** word = "abcde"

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** The remapped keypad given in the image provides the minimum cost. 

"a" -> one push on key 2 

"b" -> one push on key 3 

"c" -> one push on key 4 

"d" -> one push on key 5 

"e" -> one push on key 6 

Total cost is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5. 

It can be shown that no other mapping can provide a lower cost.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** word = "xycdefghij"

**Output:** 12

**Explanation:** The remapped keypad given in the image provides the minimum cost. 

"x" -> one push on key 2 

"y" -> two pushes on key 2 

"c" -> one push on key 3 

"d" -> two pushes on key 3 

"e" -> one push on key 4 

"f" -> one push on key 5 

"g" -> one push on key 6 

"h" -> one push on key 7 

"i" -> one push on key 8 

"j" -> one push on key 9

Total cost is 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 12. 

It can be shown that no other mapping can provide a lower cost.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= word.length <= 26`
*   `word` consists of lowercase English letters.
*   All letters in `word` are distinct.
