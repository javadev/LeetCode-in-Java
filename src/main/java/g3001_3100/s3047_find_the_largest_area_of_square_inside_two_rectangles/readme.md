3047\. Find the Largest Area of Square Inside Two Rectangles

Medium

There exist `n` rectangles in a 2D plane. You are given two **0-indexed** 2D integer arrays `bottomLeft` and `topRight`, both of size `n x 2`, where `bottomLeft[i]` and `topRight[i]` represent the **bottom-left** and **top-right** coordinates of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> rectangle respectively.

You can select a region formed from the **intersection** of two of the given rectangles. You need to find the **largest** area of a **square** that can fit **inside** this region if you select the region optimally.

Return _the **largest** possible area of a square, or_ `0` _if there **do not** exist any intersecting regions between the rectangles_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** bottomLeft = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,1]], topRight = [[3,3],[4,4],[6,6]]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** A square with side length 1 can fit inside either the intersecting region of rectangle 0 and rectangle 1, or the intersecting region of rectangle 1 and rectangle 2. Hence the largest area is side \* side which is 1 \* 1 == 1.

It can be shown that a square with a greater side length can not fit inside any intersecting region.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** bottomLeft = [[1,1],[2,2],[1,2]], topRight = [[3,3],[4,4],[3,4]]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** A square with side length 1 can fit inside either the intersecting region of rectangle 0 and rectangle 1, the intersecting region of rectangle 1 and rectangle 2, or the intersection region of all 3 rectangles. Hence the largest area is side \* side which is 1 \* 1 == 1.

It can be shown that a square with a greater side length can not fit inside any intersecting region. Note that the region can be formed by the intersection of more than 2 rectangles.

**Example 3:**

![](rectanglesexample3.png)

**Input:** bottomLeft = [[1,1],[3,3],[3,1]], topRight = [[2,2],[4,4],[4,2]]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** No pair of rectangles intersect, hence, we return 0.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == bottomLeft.length == topRight.length`
*   <code>2 <= n <= 10<sup>3</sup></code>
*   `bottomLeft[i].length == topRight[i].length == 2`
*   <code>1 <= bottomLeft[i][0], bottomLeft[i][1] <= 10<sup>7</sup></code>
*   <code>1 <= topRight[i][0], topRight[i][1] <= 10<sup>7</sup></code>
*   `bottomLeft[i][0] < topRight[i][0]`
*   `bottomLeft[i][1] < topRight[i][1]`
