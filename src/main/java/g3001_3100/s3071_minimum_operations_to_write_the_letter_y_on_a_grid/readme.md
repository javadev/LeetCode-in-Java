3071\. Minimum Operations to Write the Letter Y on a Grid

Medium

You are given a **0-indexed** `n x n` grid where `n` is odd, and `grid[r][c]` is `0`, `1`, or `2`.

We say that a cell belongs to the Letter **Y** if it belongs to one of the following:

*   The diagonal starting at the top-left cell and ending at the center cell of the grid.
*   The diagonal starting at the top-right cell and ending at the center cell of the grid.
*   The vertical line starting at the center cell and ending at the bottom border of the grid.

The Letter **Y** is written on the grid if and only if:

*   All values at cells belonging to the Y are equal.
*   All values at cells not belonging to the Y are equal.
*   The values at cells belonging to the Y are different from the values at cells not belonging to the Y.

Return _the **minimum** number of operations needed to write the letter Y on the grid given that in one operation you can change the value at any cell to_ `0`_,_ `1`_,_ _or_ `2`_._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,2,2],[1,1,0],[0,1,0]]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** We can write Y on the grid by applying the changes highlighted in blue in the image above. After the operations, all cells that belong to Y, denoted in bold, have the same value of 1 while those that do not belong to Y are equal to 0. It can be shown that 3 is the minimum number of operations needed to write Y on the grid.

**Example 2:**

![](https://leetcode-in-java.github.io/src/main/java/g3001_3100/s3071_minimum_operations_to_write_the_letter_y_on_a_grid/y3.png)

**Input:** grid = [[0,1,0,1,0],[2,1,0,1,2],[2,2,2,0,1],[2,2,2,2,2],[2,1,2,2,2]]

**Output:** 12

**Explanation:** We can write Y on the grid by applying the changes highlighted in blue in the image above. After the operations, all cells that belong to Y, denoted in bold, have the same value of 0 while those that do not belong to Y are equal to 2. It can be shown that 12 is the minimum number of operations needed to write Y on the grid.

**Constraints:**

*   `3 <= n <= 49`
*   `n == grid.length == grid[i].length`
*   `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 2`
*   `n` is odd.
