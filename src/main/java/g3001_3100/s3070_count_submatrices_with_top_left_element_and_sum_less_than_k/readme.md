3070\. Count Submatrices with Top-Left Element and Sum Less Than k

Medium

You are given a **0-indexed** integer matrix `grid` and an integer `k`.

Return _the **number** of submatrices that contain the top-left element of the_ `grid`, _and have a sum less than or equal to_ `k`.

**Example 1:**

![](example1.png)

**Input:** grid = [[7,6,3],[6,6,1]], k = 18

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** There are only 4 submatrices, shown in the image above, that contain the top-left element of grid, and have a sum less than or equal to 18.

**Example 2:**

![](example21.png)

**Input:** grid = [[7,2,9],[1,5,0],[2,6,6]], k = 20

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:** There are only 6 submatrices, shown in the image above, that contain the top-left element of grid, and have a sum less than or equal to 20.

**Constraints:**

*   `m == grid.length`
*   `n == grid[i].length`
*   `1 <= n, m <= 1000`
*   `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 1000`
*   <code>1 <= k <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>
