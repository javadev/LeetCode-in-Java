3843\. First Element with Unique Frequency

Medium

You are given an integer array `nums`.

Return an integer denoting the **first** element (scanning from left to right) in `nums` whose **frequency** is **unique**. That is, no other integer appears the same number of times in `nums`. If there is no such element, return -1.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [20,10,30,30]

**Output:** 30

**Explanation:**

*   20 appears once.
*   10 appears once.
*   30 appears twice.
*   The frequency of 30 is unique because no other integer appears exactly twice.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [20,20,10,30,30,30]

**Output:** 20

**Explanation:**

*   20 appears twice.
*   10 appears once.
*   30 appears 3 times.
*   The frequency of 20, 10, and 30 are unique. The first element that has unique frequency is 20.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [10,10,20,20]

**Output:** \-1

**Explanation:**

*   10 appears twice.
*   20 appears twice.
*   No element has a unique frequency.

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   <code>1 <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
