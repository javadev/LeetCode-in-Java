45\. Jump Game II

Medium

You are given a **0-indexed** array of integers `nums` of length `n`. You are initially positioned at index 0.

Each element `nums[i]` represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index `i`. In other words, if you are at index `i`, you can jump to any index `(i + j)` where:

*   `0 <= j <= nums[i]` and
*   `i + j < n`

Return _the minimum number of jumps to reach index_ `n - 1`. The test cases are generated such that you can reach index `n - 1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,3,1,1,4]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index. 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [2,3,0,1,4]

**Output:** 2 

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
*   It's guaranteed that you can reach `nums[n - 1]`.
