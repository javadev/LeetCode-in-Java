**Time Complexity (Big O Time):**

The time complexity of this program is O(L), where "L" is the length of the input linked list `head`. Here's the breakdown:

1. The program uses a recursive approach to remove the nth node from the end of the linked list.

2. The `removeNthFromEnd` method is called recursively for each node in the linked list. The recursive calls traverse the entire list once, visiting each node exactly once.

3. Since the recursive calls traverse the entire list, the total number of operations performed is proportional to the length of the linked list `head`, which is "L."

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(L), where "L" is the length of the linked list.

**Space Complexity (Big O Space):**

The space complexity of this program is O(L), where "L" is the length of the input linked list `head`. Here's why:

1. The program uses a recursive approach, and for each recursive call, it adds a new frame to the call stack. In the worst case, when the linked list is traversed from beginning to end, there can be a maximum of "L" recursive calls on the stack at once.

2. Each recursive call stores local variables and a reference to the next recursive call. The space used by each call frame is constant, but the number of frames on the stack is proportional to the length of the linked list.

3. Additionally, the program uses a few integer variables and references to linked list nodes, but these use constant space relative to the input size.

Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(L), where "L" is the length of the linked list.
