11\. Container With Most Water

Medium

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return _the maximum amount of water a container can store_.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]

**Output:** 49

**Explanation:** The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49. 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** height = [1,1]

**Output:** 1 

**Constraints:**

*   `n == height.length`
*   <code>2 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   <code>0 <= height[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
