100\. Same Tree

Easy

Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]

**Output:** true 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]

**Output:** false 

**Example 3:**

**Input:** p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]

**Output:** false 

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in both trees is in the range `[0, 100]`.
*   <code>-10<sup>4</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
