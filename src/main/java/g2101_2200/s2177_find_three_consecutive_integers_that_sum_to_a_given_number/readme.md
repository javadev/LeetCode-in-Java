2177\. Find Three Consecutive Integers That Sum to a Given Number

Medium

Given an integer `num`, return _three consecutive integers (as a sorted array)_ _that **sum** to_ `num`. If `num` cannot be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers, return _an **empty** array._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num = 33

**Output:** [10,11,12]

**Explanation:** 33 can be expressed as 10 + 11 + 12 = 33. 

10, 11, 12 are 3 consecutive integers, so we return [10, 11, 12]. 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num = 4

**Output:** []

**Explanation:** There is no way to express 4 as the sum of 3 consecutive integers. 

**Constraints:**

*   <code>0 <= num <= 10<sup>15</sup></code>
