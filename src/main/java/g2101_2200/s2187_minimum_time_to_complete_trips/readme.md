2187\. Minimum Time to Complete Trips

Medium

You are given an array `time` where `time[i]` denotes the time taken by the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> bus to complete **one trip**.

Each bus can make multiple trips **successively**; that is, the next trip can start **immediately after** completing the current trip. Also, each bus operates **independently**; that is, the trips of one bus do not influence the trips of any other bus.

You are also given an integer `totalTrips`, which denotes the number of trips all buses should make **in total**. Return _the **minimum time** required for all buses to complete **at least**_ `totalTrips` _trips_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** time = [1,2,3], totalTrips = 5

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

- At time t = 1, the number of trips completed by each bus are [1,0,0].

The total number of trips completed is 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.

- At time t = 2, the number of trips completed by each bus are [2,1,0].

The total number of trips completed is 2 + 1 + 0 = 3.

- At time t = 3, the number of trips completed by each bus are [3,1,1].

The total number of trips completed is 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.

So the minimum time needed for all buses to complete at least 5 trips is 3. 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** time = [2], totalTrips = 1

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

There is only one bus, and it will complete its first trip at t = 2.

So the minimum time needed to complete 1 trip is 2. 

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= time.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   <code>1 <= time[i], totalTrips <= 10<sup>7</sup></code>
