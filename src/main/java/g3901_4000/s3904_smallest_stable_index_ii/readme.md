3904\. Smallest Stable Index II

Medium

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `k`.

For each index `i`, define its **instability score** as `max(nums[0..i]) - min(nums[i..n - 1])`.

In other words:

*   `max(nums[0..i])` is the **largest** value among the elements from index 0 to index `i`.
*   `min(nums[i..n - 1])` is the **smallest** value among the elements from index `i` to index `n - 1`.

An index `i` is called **stable** if its instability score is **less than or equal to** `k`.

Return the **smallest** stable index. If no such index exists, return -1.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [5,0,1,4], k = 3

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

*   At index 0: The maximum in `[5]` is 5, and the minimum in `[5, 0, 1, 4]` is 0, so the instability score is `5 - 0 = 5`.
*   At index 1: The maximum in `[5, 0]` is 5, and the minimum in `[0, 1, 4]` is 0, so the instability score is `5 - 0 = 5`.
*   At index 2: The maximum in `[5, 0, 1]` is 5, and the minimum in `[1, 4]` is 1, so the instability score is `5 - 1 = 4`.
*   At index 3: The maximum in `[5, 0, 1, 4]` is 5, and the minimum in `[4]` is 4, so the instability score is `5 - 4 = 1`.
*   This is the first index with an instability score less than or equal to `k = 3`. Thus, the answer is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [3,2,1], k = 1

**Output:** \-1

**Explanation:**

*   At index 0, the instability score is `3 - 1 = 2`.
*   At index 1, the instability score is `3 - 1 = 2`.
*   At index 2, the instability score is `3 - 1 = 2`.
*   None of these values is less than or equal to `k = 1`, so the answer is -1.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [0], k = 0

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

At index 0, the instability score is `0 - 0 = 0`, which is less than or equal to `k = 0`. Therefore, the answer is 0.

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   <code>0 <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>
*   <code>0 <= k <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>
