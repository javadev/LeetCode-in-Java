3918\. Sum of Primes Between Number and Its Reverse

Medium

You are given an integer `n`.

Let `r` be the integer formed by reversing the digits of `n`.

Return the **sum** of all prime numbers between `min(n, r)` and `max(n, r)`, inclusive.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 13

**Output:** 132

**Explanation:**

*   The reverse of 13 is 31. Thus, the range is `[13, 31]`.
*   The prime numbers in this range are 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31.
*   The sum of these prime numbers is `13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + 29 + 31 = 132`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 10

**Output:** 17

**Explanation:**

*   The reverse of 10 is 1. Thus, the range is `[1, 10]`.
*   The prime numbers in this range are 2, 3, 5, and 7.
*   The sum of these prime numbers is `2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 8

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

*   The reverse of 8 is 8. Thus, the range is `[8, 8]`.
*   There are no prime numbers in this range, so the sum is 0.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 1000`
