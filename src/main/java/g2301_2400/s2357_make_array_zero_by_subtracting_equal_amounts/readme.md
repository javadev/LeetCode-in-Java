2357\. Make Array Zero by Subtracting Equal Amounts

Easy

You are given a non-negative integer array `nums`. In one operation, you must:

*   Choose a positive integer `x` such that `x` is less than or equal to the **smallest non-zero** element in `nums`.
*   Subtract `x` from every **positive** element in `nums`.

Return _the **minimum** number of operations to make every element in_ `nums` _equal to_ `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,5,0,3,5]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

In the first operation, choose x = 1. Now, nums = [0,4,0,2,4].

In the second operation, choose x = 2. Now, nums = [0,2,0,0,2].

In the third operation, choose x = 2. Now, nums = [0,0,0,0,0]. 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [0]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** Each element in nums is already 0 so no operations are needed. 

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`
