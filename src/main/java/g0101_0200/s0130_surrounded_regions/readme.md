130\. Surrounded Regions

Medium

You are given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing **letters** `'X'` and `'O'`, **capture regions** that are **surrounded**:

*   **Connect**: A cell is connected to adjacent cells horizontally or vertically.
*   **Region**: To form a region **connect every** `'O'` cell.
*   **Surround**: The region is surrounded with `'X'` cells if you can **connect the region** with `'X'` cells and none of the region cells are on the edge of the `board`.

To capture a **surrounded region**, replace all `'O'`s with `'X'`s **in-place** within the original board. You do not need to return anything.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]

**Output:** [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]

**Explanation:**

In the above diagram, the bottom region is not captured because it is on the edge of the board and cannot be surrounded.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board = [["X"]]

**Output:** [["X"]]

**Constraints:**

*   `m == board.length`
*   `n == board[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 200`
*   `board[i][j]` is `'X'` or `'O'`.
