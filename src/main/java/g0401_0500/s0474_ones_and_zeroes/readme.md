474\. Ones and Zeroes

Medium

You are given an array of binary strings `strs` and two integers `m` and `n`.

Return _the size of the largest subset of `strs` such that there are **at most**_ `m` `0`_'s and_ `n` `1`_'s in the subset_.

A set `x` is a **subset** of a set `y` if all elements of `x` are also elements of `y`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** strs = ["10","0001","111001","1","0"], m = 5, n = 3

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** The largest subset with at most 5 0's and 3 1's is {"10", "0001", "1", "0"}, so the answer is 4. Other valid but smaller subsets include {"0001", "1"} and {"10", "1", "0"}. {"111001"} is an invalid subset because it contains 4 1's, greater than the maximum of 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** strs = ["10","0","1"], m = 1, n = 1

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** The largest subset is {"0", "1"}, so the answer is 2.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= strs.length <= 600`
*   `1 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
*   `strs[i]` consists only of digits `'0'` and `'1'`.
*   `1 <= m, n <= 100`
