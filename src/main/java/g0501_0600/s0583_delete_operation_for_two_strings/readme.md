583\. Delete Operation for Two Strings

Medium

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return _the minimum number of **steps** required to make_ `word1` _and_ `word2` _the same_.

In one **step**, you can delete exactly one character in either string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** word1 = "sea", word2 = "eat"

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make "eat" to "ea".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** word1 = "leetcode", word2 = "etco"

**Output:** 4

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500`
*   `word1` and `word2` consist of only lowercase English letters.
