572\. Subtree of Another Tree

Easy

Given the roots of two binary trees `root` and `subRoot`, return `true` if there is a subtree of `root` with the same structure and node values of `subRoot` and `false` otherwise.

A subtree of a binary tree `tree` is a tree that consists of a node in `tree` and all of this node's descendants. The tree `tree` could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]

**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/28/subtree2-tree.jpg)

**Input:** root = [3,4,5,1,2,null,null,null,null,0], subRoot = [4,1,2]

**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the `root` tree is in the range `[1, 2000]`.
*   The number of nodes in the `subRoot` tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
*   <code>-10<sup>4</sup> <= root.val <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
*   <code>-10<sup>4</sup> <= subRoot.val <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
