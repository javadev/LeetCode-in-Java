3248\. Snake in Matrix

Easy

There is a snake in an `n x n` matrix `grid` and can move in **four possible directions**. Each cell in the `grid` is identified by the position: `grid[i][j] = (i * n) + j`.

The snake starts at cell 0 and follows a sequence of commands.

You are given an integer `n` representing the size of the `grid` and an array of strings `commands` where each `command[i]` is either `"UP"`, `"RIGHT"`, `"DOWN"`, and `"LEFT"`. It's guaranteed that the snake will remain within the `grid` boundaries throughout its movement.

Return the position of the final cell where the snake ends up after executing `commands`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2, commands = ["RIGHT","DOWN"]

**Output:** 3

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= n <= 10`
*   `1 <= commands.length <= 100`
*   `commands` consists only of `"UP"`, `"RIGHT"`, `"DOWN"`, and `"LEFT"`.
*   The input is generated such the snake will not move outside of the boundaries.
