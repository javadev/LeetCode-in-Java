3241\. Time Taken to Mark All Nodes

Hard

There exists an **undirected** tree with `n` nodes numbered `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree.

Initially, **all** nodes are **unmarked**. For each node `i`:

*   If `i` is odd, the node will get marked at time `x` if there is **at least** one node _adjacent_ to it which was marked at time `x - 1`.
*   If `i` is even, the node will get marked at time `x` if there is **at least** one node _adjacent_ to it which was marked at time `x - 2`.

Return an array `times` where `times[i]` is the time when all nodes get marked in the tree, if you mark node `i` at time `t = 0`.

**Note** that the answer for each `times[i]` is **independent**, i.e. when you mark node `i` all other nodes are _unmarked_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** edges = [[0,1],[0,2]]

**Output:** [2,4,3]

**Explanation:**

*   For `i = 0`:
    *   Node 1 is marked at `t = 1`, and Node 2 at `t = 2`.
*   For `i = 1`:
    *   Node 0 is marked at `t = 2`, and Node 2 at `t = 4`.
*   For `i = 2`:
    *   Node 0 is marked at `t = 2`, and Node 1 at `t = 3`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** edges = [[0,1]]

**Output:** [1,2]

**Explanation:**

*   For `i = 0`:
    *   Node 1 is marked at `t = 1`.
*   For `i = 1`:
    *   Node 0 is marked at `t = 2`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** edges = [[2,4],[0,1],[2,3],[0,2]]

**Output:** [4,6,3,5,5]

**Constraints:**

*   <code>2 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   `edges.length == n - 1`
*   `edges[i].length == 2`
*   `0 <= edges[i][0], edges[i][1] <= n - 1`
*   The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.
