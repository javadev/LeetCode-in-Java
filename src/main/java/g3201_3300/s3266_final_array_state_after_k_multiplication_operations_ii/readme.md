3266\. Final Array State After K Multiplication Operations II

Hard

You are given an integer array `nums`, an integer `k`, and an integer `multiplier`.

You need to perform `k` operations on `nums`. In each operation:

*   Find the **minimum** value `x` in `nums`. If there are multiple occurrences of the minimum value, select the one that appears **first**.
*   Replace the selected minimum value `x` with `x * multiplier`.

After the `k` operations, apply **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code> to every value in `nums`.

Return an integer array denoting the _final state_ of `nums` after performing all `k` operations and then applying the modulo.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,1,3,5,6], k = 5, multiplier = 2

**Output:** [8,4,6,5,6]

**Explanation:**

Operation

Result

After operation 1

[2, 2, 3, 5, 6]

After operation 2

[4, 2, 3, 5, 6]

After operation 3

[4, 4, 3, 5, 6]

After operation 4

[4, 4, 6, 5, 6]

After operation 5

[8, 4, 6, 5, 6]

After applying modulo

[8, 4, 6, 5, 6]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [100000,2000], k = 2, multiplier = 1000000

**Output:** [999999307,999999993]

**Explanation:**

Operation

Result

After operation 1

[100000, 2000000000]

After operation 2

[100000000000, 2000000000]

After applying modulo

[999999307, 999999993]

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
*   <code>1 <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>
*   <code>1 <= k <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>
*   <code>1 <= multiplier <= 10<sup>6</sup></code>
