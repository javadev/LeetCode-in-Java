3203\. Find Minimum Diameter After Merging Two Trees

Hard

There exist two **undirected** trees with `n` and `m` nodes, numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and from `0` to `m - 1`, respectively. You are given two 2D integer arrays `edges1` and `edges2` of lengths `n - 1` and `m - 1`, respectively, where <code>edges1[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the first tree and <code>edges2[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> in the second tree.

You must connect one node from the first tree with another node from the second tree with an edge.

Return the **minimum** possible **diameter** of the resulting tree.

The **diameter** of a tree is the length of the _longest_ path between any two nodes in the tree.

**Example 1:**![](example11-transformed.png)

**Input:** edges1 = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]], edges2 = [[0,1]]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

We can obtain a tree of diameter 3 by connecting node 0 from the first tree with any node from the second tree.

**Example 2:**

![](example211.png)

**Input:** edges1 = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[2,4],[2,5],[3,6],[2,7]], edges2 = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[2,4],[2,5],[3,6],[2,7]]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:**

We can obtain a tree of diameter 5 by connecting node 0 from the first tree with node 0 from the second tree.

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= n, m <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   `edges1.length == n - 1`
*   `edges2.length == m - 1`
*   `edges1[i].length == edges2[i].length == 2`
*   <code>edges1[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code>
*   <code>0 <= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> < n</code>
*   <code>edges2[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code>
*   <code>0 <= u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub> < m</code>
*   The input is generated such that `edges1` and `edges2` represent valid trees.
