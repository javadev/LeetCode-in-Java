3286\. Find a Safe Walk Through a Grid

Medium

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid` and an integer `health`.

You start on the upper-left corner `(0, 0)` and would like to get to the lower-right corner `(m - 1, n - 1)`.

You can move up, down, left, or right from one cell to another adjacent cell as long as your health _remains_ **positive**.

Cells `(i, j)` with `grid[i][j] = 1` are considered **unsafe** and reduce your health by 1.

Return `true` if you can reach the final cell with a health value of 1 or more, and `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = [[0,1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1,0]], health = 1

**Output:** true

**Explanation:**

The final cell can be reached safely by walking along the gray cells below.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = [[0,1,1,0,0,0],[1,0,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1,0,1],[0,0,1,0,1,0]], health = 3

**Output:** false

**Explanation:**

A minimum of 4 health points is needed to reach the final cell safely.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]], health = 5

**Output:** true

**Explanation:**

The final cell can be reached safely by walking along the gray cells below.

Any path that does not go through the cell `(1, 1)` is unsafe since your health will drop to 0 when reaching the final cell.

**Constraints:**

*   `m == grid.length`
*   `n == grid[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 50`
*   `2 <= m * n`
*   `1 <= health <= m + n`
*   `grid[i][j]` is either 0 or 1.
