3219\. Minimum Cost for Cutting Cake II

Hard

There is an `m x n` cake that needs to be cut into `1 x 1` pieces.

You are given integers `m`, `n`, and two arrays:

*   `horizontalCut` of size `m - 1`, where `horizontalCut[i]` represents the cost to cut along the horizontal line `i`.
*   `verticalCut` of size `n - 1`, where `verticalCut[j]` represents the cost to cut along the vertical line `j`.

In one operation, you can choose any piece of cake that is not yet a `1 x 1` square and perform one of the following cuts:

1.  Cut along a horizontal line `i` at a cost of `horizontalCut[i]`.
2.  Cut along a vertical line `j` at a cost of `verticalCut[j]`.

After the cut, the piece of cake is divided into two distinct pieces.

The cost of a cut depends only on the initial cost of the line and does not change.

Return the **minimum** total cost to cut the entire cake into `1 x 1` pieces.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** m = 3, n = 2, horizontalCut = [1,3], verticalCut = [5]

**Output:** 13

*   Perform a cut on the vertical line 0 with cost 5, current total cost is 5.
*   Perform a cut on the horizontal line 0 on `3 x 1` subgrid with cost 1.
*   Perform a cut on the horizontal line 0 on `3 x 1` subgrid with cost 1.
*   Perform a cut on the horizontal line 1 on `2 x 1` subgrid with cost 3.
*   Perform a cut on the horizontal line 1 on `2 x 1` subgrid with cost 3.

The total cost is `5 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 13`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** m = 2, n = 2, horizontalCut = [7], verticalCut = [4]

**Output:** 15

**Explanation:**

*   Perform a cut on the horizontal line 0 with cost 7.
*   Perform a cut on the vertical line 0 on `1 x 2` subgrid with cost 4.
*   Perform a cut on the vertical line 0 on `1 x 2` subgrid with cost 4.

The total cost is `7 + 4 + 4 = 15`.

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= m, n <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   `horizontalCut.length == m - 1`
*   `verticalCut.length == n - 1`
*   <code>1 <= horizontalCut[i], verticalCut[i] <= 10<sup>3</sup></code>
