3249\. Count the Number of Good Nodes

Medium

There is an **undirected** tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, and rooted at node `0`. You are given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree.

A node is **good** if all the subtrees rooted at its children have the same size.

Return the number of **good** nodes in the given tree.

A **subtree** of `treeName` is a tree consisting of a node in `treeName` and all of its descendants.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6]]

**Output:** 7

**Explanation:**

![](tree1.png)

All of the nodes of the given tree are good.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[0,5],[1,6],[2,7],[3,8]]

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

There are 6 good nodes in the given tree. They are colored in the image above.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[0,5],[5,6],[6,7],[7,8],[0,9],[9,10],[9,12],[10,11]]

**Output:** 12

**Explanation:**

All nodes except node 9 are good.

**Constraints:**

*   <code>2 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   `edges.length == n - 1`
*   `edges[i].length == 2`
*   <code>0 <= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> < n</code>
*   The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.
