1471\. The k Strongest Values in an Array

Medium

Given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `k`.

A value `arr[i]` is said to be stronger than a value `arr[j]` if `|arr[i] - m| > |arr[j] - m|` where `m` is the **median** of the array.  
If `|arr[i] - m| == |arr[j] - m|`, then `arr[i]` is said to be stronger than `arr[j]` if `arr[i] > arr[j]`.

Return _a list of the strongest `k`_ values in the array. return the answer **in any arbitrary order**.

**Median** is the middle value in an ordered integer list. More formally, if the length of the list is n, the median is the element in position `((n - 1) / 2)` in the sorted list **(0-indexed)**.

*   For `arr = [6, -3, 7, 2, 11]`, `n = 5` and the median is obtained by sorting the array `arr = [-3, 2, 6, 7, 11]` and the median is `arr[m]` where `m = ((5 - 1) / 2) = 2`. The median is `6`.
*   For `arr = [-7, 22, 17,â€‰3]`, `n = 4` and the median is obtained by sorting the array `arr = [-7, 3, 17, 22]` and the median is `arr[m]` where `m = ((4 - 1) / 2) = 1`. The median is `3`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2

**Output:** [5,1]

**Explanation:** Median is 3, the elements of the array sorted by the strongest are [5,1,4,2,3]. The strongest 2 elements are [5, 1]. [1, 5] is also **accepted** answer. Please note that although |5 - 3| == |1 - 3| but 5 is stronger than 1 because 5 > 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = [1,1,3,5,5], k = 2

**Output:** [5,5]

**Explanation:** Median is 3, the elements of the array sorted by the strongest are [5,5,1,1,3]. The strongest 2 elements are [5, 5].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** arr = [6,7,11,7,6,8], k = 5

**Output:** [11,8,6,6,7]

**Explanation:** Median is 7, the elements of the array sorted by the strongest are [11,8,6,6,7,7]. Any permutation of [11,8,6,6,7] is **accepted**.

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= arr.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   <code>-10<sup>5</sup> <= arr[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   `1 <= k <= arr.length`
