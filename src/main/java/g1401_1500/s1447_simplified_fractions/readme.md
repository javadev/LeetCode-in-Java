Medium

Given an integer `n`, return _a list of all **simplified** fractions between_ `0` _and_ `1` _(exclusive) such that the denominator is less-than-or-equal-to_ `n`. You can return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2

**Output:** ["1/2"]

**Explanation:** "1/2" is the only unique fraction with a denominator less-than-or-equal-to 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3

**Output:** ["1/2","1/3","2/3"]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 4

**Output:** ["1/2","1/3","1/4","2/3","3/4"]

**Explanation:** "2/4" is not a simplified fraction because it can be simplified to "1/2".

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 100`
