3420\. Count Non-Decreasing Subarrays After K Operations

Hard

You are given an array `nums` of `n` integers and an integer `k`.

For each subarray of `nums`, you can apply **up to** `k` operations on it. In each operation, you increment any element of the subarray by 1.

**Note** that each subarray is considered independently, meaning changes made to one subarray do not persist to another.

Return the number of subarrays that you can make **non-decreasing** after performing at most `k` operations.

An array is said to be **non-decreasing** if each element is greater than or equal to its previous element, if it exists.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [6,3,1,2,4,4], k = 7

**Output:** 17

**Explanation:**

Out of all 21 possible subarrays of `nums`, only the subarrays `[6, 3, 1]`, `[6, 3, 1, 2]`, `[6, 3, 1, 2, 4]` and `[6, 3, 1, 2, 4, 4]` cannot be made non-decreasing after applying up to k = 7 operations. Thus, the number of non-decreasing subarrays is `21 - 4 = 17`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [6,3,1,3,6], k = 4

**Output:** 12

**Explanation:**

The subarray `[3, 1, 3, 6]` along with all subarrays of `nums` with three or fewer elements, except `[6, 3, 1]`, can be made non-decreasing after `k` operations. There are 5 subarrays of a single element, 4 subarrays of two elements, and 2 subarrays of three elements except `[6, 3, 1]`, so there are `1 + 5 + 4 + 2 = 12` subarrays that can be made non-decreasing.

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   <code>1 <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>
*   <code>1 <= k <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>
