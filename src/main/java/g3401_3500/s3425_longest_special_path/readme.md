3425\. Longest Special Path

Hard

You are given an undirected tree rooted at node `0` with `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, represented by a 2D array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>, length<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates an edge between nodes <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> with length <code>length<sub>i</sub></code>. You are also given an integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` represents the value at node `i`.

A **special path** is defined as a **downward** path from an ancestor node to a descendant node such that all the values of the nodes in that path are **unique**.

**Note** that a path may start and end at the same node.

Return an array `result` of size 2, where `result[0]` is the **length** of the **longest** special path, and `result[1]` is the **minimum** number of nodes in all _possible_ **longest** special paths.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** edges = [[0,1,2],[1,2,3],[1,3,5],[1,4,4],[2,5,6]], nums = [2,1,2,1,3,1]

**Output:** [6,2]

**Explanation:**

The longest special paths are `2 -> 5` and `0 -> 1 -> 4`, both having a length of 6. The minimum number of nodes across all longest special paths is 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** edges = [[1,0,8]], nums = [2,2]

**Output:** [0,1]

**Explanation:**

The longest special paths are `0` and `1`, both having a length of 0. The minimum number of nodes across all longest special paths is 1.

**Constraints:**

*   <code>2 <= n <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
*   `edges.length == n - 1`
*   `edges[i].length == 3`
*   <code>0 <= u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub> < n</code>
*   <code>1 <= length<sub>i</sub> <= 10<sup>3</sup></code>
*   `nums.length == n`
*   <code>0 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
*   The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.
