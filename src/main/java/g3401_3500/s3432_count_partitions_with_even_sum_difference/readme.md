3432\. Count Partitions with Even Sum Difference

Easy

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`.

A **partition** is defined as an index `i` where `0 <= i < n - 1`, splitting the array into two **non-empty** subarrays such that:

*   Left subarray contains indices `[0, i]`.
*   Right subarray contains indices `[i + 1, n - 1]`.

Return the number of **partitions** where the **difference** between the **sum** of the left and right subarrays is **even**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [10,10,3,7,6]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

The 4 partitions are:

*   `[10]`, `[10, 3, 7, 6]` with a sum difference of `10 - 26 = -16`, which is even.
*   `[10, 10]`, `[3, 7, 6]` with a sum difference of `20 - 16 = 4`, which is even.
*   `[10, 10, 3]`, `[7, 6]` with a sum difference of `23 - 13 = 10`, which is even.
*   `[10, 10, 3, 7]`, `[6]` with a sum difference of `30 - 6 = 24`, which is even.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,2]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

No partition results in an even sum difference.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [2,4,6,8]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

All partitions result in an even sum difference.

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= n == nums.length <= 100`
*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
