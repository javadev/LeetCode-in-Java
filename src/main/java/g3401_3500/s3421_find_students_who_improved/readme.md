    | Column Name | Type    |
    +-------------+---------+
    | student_id  | int     |

    +-------------+---------+
    (student_id, subject, exam_date) is the primary key for this table.
    Each row contains information about a student's score in a specific subject on a particular exam date. score is between 0 and 100 (inclusive). 

Write a solution to find the **students who have shown improvement**. A student is considered to have shown improvement if they meet **both** of these conditions:

*   Have taken exams in the **same subject** on at least two different dates
*   Their **latest score** in that subject is **higher** than their **first score**

Return _the result table_ _ordered by_ `student_id,` `subject` _in **ascending** order_.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

Scores table:

+------------+----------+-------+------------+
| student_id | subject  | score | exam_date  |
+------------+----------+-------+------------+
| 101        | Math     | 70    | 15-01-2023 |
| 101        | Math     | 85    | 15-02-2023 |
| 101        | Physics  | 65    | 15-01-2023 |
| 101        | Physics  | 60    | 15-02-2023 |
| 102        | Math     | 80    | 15-01-2023 |
| 102        | Math     | 85    | 15-02-2023 |
| 103        | Math     | 90    | 15-01-2023 |
| 104        | Physics  | 75    | 15-01-2023 |
| 104        | Physics  | 85    | 15-02-2023 |
+------------+----------+-------+------------+ 

**Output:**

+------------+----------+-------------+--------------+

+------------+----------+-------------+--------------+ 

**Explanation:**

*   Student 101 in Math: Improved from 70 to 85
*   Student 101 in Physics: No improvement (dropped from 65 to 60)
*   Student 102 in Math: Improved from 80 to 85
*   Student 103 in Math: Only one exam, not eligible
*   Student 104 in Physics: Improved from 75 to 85

Result table is ordered by student\_id, subject.
