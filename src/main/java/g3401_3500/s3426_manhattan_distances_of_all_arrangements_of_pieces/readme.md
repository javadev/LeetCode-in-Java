3426\. Manhattan Distances of All Arrangements of Pieces

Hard

You are given three integers `m`, `n`, and `k`.

There is a rectangular grid of size `m Ã— n` containing `k` identical pieces. Return the sum of Manhattan distances between every pair of pieces over all **valid arrangements** of pieces.

A **valid arrangement** is a placement of all `k` pieces on the grid with **at most** one piece per cell.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

The Manhattan Distance between two cells <code>(x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>)</code> and <code>(x<sub>j</sub>, y<sub>j</sub>)</code> is <code>|x<sub>i</sub> - x<sub>j</sub>| + |y<sub>i</sub> - y<sub>j</sub>|</code>.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** m = 2, n = 2, k = 2

**Output:** 8

**Explanation:**

The valid arrangements of pieces on the board are:

*   In the first 4 arrangements, the Manhattan distance between the two pieces is 1.
*   In the last 2 arrangements, the Manhattan distance between the two pieces is 2.

Thus, the total Manhattan distance across all valid arrangements is `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 8`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** m = 1, n = 4, k = 3

**Output:** 20

**Explanation:**

The valid arrangements of pieces on the board are:

*   The first and last arrangements have a total Manhattan distance of `1 + 1 + 2 = 4`.
*   The middle two arrangements have a total Manhattan distance of `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.

The total Manhattan distance between all pairs of pieces across all arrangements is `4 + 6 + 6 + 4 = 20`.

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= m, n <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   <code>2 <= m * n <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   `2 <= k <= m * n`
