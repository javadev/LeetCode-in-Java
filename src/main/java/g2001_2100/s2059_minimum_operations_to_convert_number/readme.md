2059\. Minimum Operations to Convert Number

Medium

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` containing **distinct** numbers, an integer `start`, and an integer `goal`. There is an integer `x` that is initially set to `start`, and you want to perform operations on `x` such that it is converted to `goal`. You can perform the following operation repeatedly on the number `x`:

If `0 <= x <= 1000`, then for any index `i` in the array (`0 <= i < nums.length`), you can set `x` to any of the following:

*   `x + nums[i]`
*   `x - nums[i]`
*   `x ^ nums[i]` (bitwise-XOR)

Note that you can use each `nums[i]` any number of times in any order. Operations that set `x` to be out of the range `0 <= x <= 1000` are valid, but no more operations can be done afterward.

Return _the **minimum** number of operations needed to convert_ `x = start` _into_ `goal`_, and_ `-1` _if it is not possible_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,4,12], start = 2, goal = 12

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** We can go from 2 → 14 → 12 with the following 2 operations. 
- 2 + 12 = 14 
- 14 - 2 = 12 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [3,5,7], start = 0, goal = -4

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** We can go from 0 → 3 → -4 with the following 2 operations. 
- 0 + 3 = 3 
- 3 - 7 = -4 

Note that the last operation sets x out of the range 0 <= x <= 1000, which is valid. 

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [2,8,16], start = 0, goal = 1

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:** 
There is no way to convert 0 into 1. 

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
*   <code>-10<sup>9</sup> <= nums[i], goal <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>
*   `0 <= start <= 1000`
*   `start != goal`
*   All the integers in `nums` are distinct.
