3507\. Minimum Pair Removal to Sort Array I

Easy

Given an array `nums`, you can perform the following operation any number of times:

*   Select the **adjacent** pair with the **minimum** sum in `nums`. If multiple such pairs exist, choose the leftmost one.
*   Replace the pair with their sum.

Return the **minimum number of operations** needed to make the array **non-decreasing**.

An array is said to be **non-decreasing** if each element is greater than or equal to its previous element (if it exists).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [5,2,3,1]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

*   The pair `(3,1)` has the minimum sum of 4. After replacement, `nums = [5,2,4]`.
*   The pair `(2,4)` has the minimum sum of 6. After replacement, `nums = [5,6]`.

The array `nums` became non-decreasing in two operations.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,2]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

The array `nums` is already sorted.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 50`
*   `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
