3568\. Minimum Moves to Clean the Classroom

Medium

You are given an `m x n` grid `classroom` where a student volunteer is tasked with cleaning up litter scattered around the room. Each cell in the grid is one of the following:

*   `'S'`: Starting position of the student
*   `'L'`: Litter that must be collected (once collected, the cell becomes empty)
*   `'R'`: Reset area that restores the student's energy to full capacity, regardless of their current energy level (can be used multiple times)
*   `'X'`: Obstacle the student cannot pass through
*   `'.'`: Empty space

You are also given an integer `energy`, representing the student's maximum energy capacity. The student starts with this energy from the starting position `'S'`.

Each move to an adjacent cell (up, down, left, or right) costs 1 unit of energy. If the energy reaches 0, the student can only continue if they are on a reset area `'R'`, which resets the energy to its **maximum** capacity `energy`.

Return the **minimum** number of moves required to collect all litter items, or `-1` if it's impossible.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** classroom = ["S.", "XL"], energy = 2

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

*   The student starts at cell `(0, 0)` with 2 units of energy.
*   Since cell `(1, 0)` contains an obstacle 'X', the student cannot move directly downward.
*   A valid sequence of moves to collect all litter is as follows:
    *   Move 1: From `(0, 0)` → `(0, 1)` with 1 unit of energy and 1 unit remaining.
    *   Move 2: From `(0, 1)` → `(1, 1)` to collect the litter `'L'`.
*   The student collects all the litter using 2 moves. Thus, the output is 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** classroom = ["LS", "RL"], energy = 4

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

*   The student starts at cell `(0, 1)` with 4 units of energy.
*   A valid sequence of moves to collect all litter is as follows:
    *   Move 1: From `(0, 1)` → `(0, 0)` to collect the first litter `'L'` with 1 unit of energy used and 3 units remaining.
    *   Move 2: From `(0, 0)` → `(1, 0)` to `'R'` to reset and restore energy back to 4.
    *   Move 3: From `(1, 0)` → `(1, 1)` to collect the second litter `'L'`.
*   The student collects all the litter using 3 moves. Thus, the output is 3.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** classroom = ["L.S", "RXL"], energy = 3

**Output:** \-1

**Explanation:**

No valid path collects all `'L'`.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= m == classroom.length <= 20`
*   `1 <= n == classroom[i].length <= 20`
*   `classroom[i][j]` is one of `'S'`, `'L'`, `'R'`, `'X'`, or `'.'`
*   `1 <= energy <= 50`
*   There is exactly **one** `'S'` in the grid.
*   There are **at most** 10 `'L'` cells in the grid.
