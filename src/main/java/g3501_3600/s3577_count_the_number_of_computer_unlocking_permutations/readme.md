3577\. Count the Number of Computer Unlocking Permutations

Medium

You are given an array `complexity` of length `n`.

There are `n` **locked** computers in a room with labels from 0 to `n - 1`, each with its own **unique** password. The password of the computer `i` has a complexity `complexity[i]`.

The password for the computer labeled 0 is **already** decrypted and serves as the root. All other computers must be unlocked using it or another previously unlocked computer, following this information:

*   You can decrypt the password for the computer `i` using the password for computer `j`, where `j` is **any** integer less than `i` with a lower complexity. (i.e. `j < i` and `complexity[j] < complexity[i]`)
*   To decrypt the password for computer `i`, you must have already unlocked a computer `j` such that `j < i` and `complexity[j] < complexity[i]`.

Find the number of permutations of `[0, 1, 2, ..., (n - 1)]` that represent a valid order in which the computers can be unlocked, starting from computer 0 as the only initially unlocked one.

Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** 10<sup>9</sup> + 7.

**Note** that the password for the computer **with label** 0 is decrypted, and _not_ the computer with the first position in the permutation.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** complexity = [1,2,3]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The valid permutations are:

*   [0, 1, 2]
    *   Unlock computer 0 first with root password.
    *   Unlock computer 1 with password of computer 0 since `complexity[0] < complexity[1]`.
    *   Unlock computer 2 with password of computer 1 since `complexity[1] < complexity[2]`.
*   [0, 2, 1]
    *   Unlock computer 0 first with root password.
    *   Unlock computer 2 with password of computer 0 since `complexity[0] < complexity[2]`.
    *   Unlock computer 1 with password of computer 0 since `complexity[0] < complexity[1]`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** complexity = [3,3,3,4,4,4]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

There are no possible permutations which can unlock all computers.

**Constraints:**

*   <code>2 <= complexity.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   <code>1 <= complexity[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>
