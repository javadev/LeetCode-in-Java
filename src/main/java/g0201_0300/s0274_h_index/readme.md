274\. H-Index

Medium

Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> paper, return _the researcher's h-index_.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): The h-index is defined as the maximum value of `h` such that the given researcher has published at least `h` papers that have each been cited at least `h` times.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** citations = [3,0,6,1,5]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3. 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** citations = [1,3,1]

**Output:** 1 

**Constraints:**

*   `n == citations.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 5000`
*   `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`
