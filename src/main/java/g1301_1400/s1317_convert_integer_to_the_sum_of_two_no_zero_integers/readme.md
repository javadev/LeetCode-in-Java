1317\. Convert Integer to the Sum of Two No-Zero Integers

Easy

**No-Zero integer** is a positive integer that **does not contain any `0`** in its decimal representation.

Given an integer `n`, return _a list of two integers_ `[A, B]` _where_:

*   `A` and `B` are **No-Zero integers**.
*   `A + B = n`

The test cases are generated so that there is at least one valid solution. If there are many valid solutions you can return any of them.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2

**Output:** [1,1]

**Explanation:** A = 1, B = 1. A + B = n and both A and B do not contain any 0 in their decimal representation.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 11

**Output:** [2,9]

**Constraints:**

*   <code>2 <= n <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
