966\. Vowel Spellchecker

Medium

Given a `wordlist`, we want to implement a spellchecker that converts a query word into a correct word.

For a given `query` word, the spell checker handles two categories of spelling mistakes:

*   Capitalization: If the query matches a word in the wordlist (**case-insensitive**), then the query word is returned with the same case as the case in the wordlist.
    *   Example: `wordlist = ["yellow"]`, `query = "YellOw"`: `correct = "yellow"`
    *   Example: `wordlist = ["Yellow"]`, `query = "yellow"`: `correct = "Yellow"`
    *   Example: `wordlist = ["yellow"]`, `query = "yellow"`: `correct = "yellow"`
*   Vowel Errors: If after replacing the vowels `('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')` of the query word with any vowel individually, it matches a word in the wordlist (**case-insensitive**), then the query word is returned with the same case as the match in the wordlist.
    *   Example: `wordlist = ["YellOw"]`, `query = "yollow"`: `correct = "YellOw"`
    *   Example: `wordlist = ["YellOw"]`, `query = "yeellow"`: `correct = ""` (no match)
    *   Example: `wordlist = ["YellOw"]`, `query = "yllw"`: `correct = ""` (no match)

In addition, the spell checker operates under the following precedence rules:

*   When the query exactly matches a word in the wordlist (**case-sensitive**), you should return the same word back.
*   When the query matches a word up to capitlization, you should return the first such match in the wordlist.
*   When the query matches a word up to vowel errors, you should return the first such match in the wordlist.
*   If the query has no matches in the wordlist, you should return the empty string.

Given some `queries`, return a list of words `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the correct word for `query = queries[i]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** wordlist = ["KiTe","kite","hare","Hare"], queries = ["kite","Kite","KiTe","Hare","HARE","Hear","hear","keti","keet","keto"]

**Output:** ["kite","KiTe","KiTe","Hare","hare","","","KiTe","","KiTe"]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** wordlist = ["yellow"], queries = ["YellOw"]

**Output:** ["yellow"]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= wordlist.length, queries.length <= 5000`
*   `1 <= wordlist[i].length, queries[i].length <= 7`
*   `wordlist[i]` and `queries[i]` consist only of only English letters.
