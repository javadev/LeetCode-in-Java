906\. Super Palindromes

Hard

Let's say a positive integer is a **super-palindrome** if it is a palindrome, and it is also the square of a palindrome.

Given two positive integers `left` and `right` represented as strings, return _the number of **super-palindromes** integers in the inclusive range_ `[left, right]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** left = "4", right = "1000"

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** 4, 9, 121, and 484 are superpalindromes. Note that 676 is not a superpalindrome: 26 \* 26 = 676, but 26 is not a palindrome.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** left = "1", right = "2"

**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= left.length, right.length <= 18`
*   `left` and `right` consist of only digits.
*   `left` and `right` cannot have leading zeros.
*   `left` and `right` represent integers in the range <code>[1, 10<sup>18</sup> - 1]</code>.
*   `left` is less than or equal to `right`.
