1979\. Find Greatest Common Divisor of Array

Easy

Given an integer array `nums`, return _the **greatest common divisor** of the smallest number and largest number in_ `nums`.

The **greatest common divisor** of two numbers is the largest positive integer that evenly divides both numbers.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,5,6,9,10]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** 

The smallest number in nums is 2. 

The largest number in nums is 10. 

The greatest common divisor of 2 and 10 is 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [7,5,6,8,3]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** 

The smallest number in nums is 3. 

The largest number in nums is 8. 

The greatest common divisor of 3 and 8 is 1.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [3,3]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** 

The smallest number in nums is 3. 

The largest number in nums is 3. 

The greatest common divisor of 3 and 3 is 3.

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= nums.length <= 1000`
*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
