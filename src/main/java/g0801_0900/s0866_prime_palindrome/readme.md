866\. Prime Palindrome

Medium

Given an integer n, return _the smallest **prime palindrome** greater than or equal to_ `n`.

An integer is **prime** if it has exactly two divisors: `1` and itself. Note that `1` is not a prime number.

*   For example, `2`, `3`, `5`, `7`, `11`, and `13` are all primes.

An integer is a **palindrome** if it reads the same from left to right as it does from right to left.

*   For example, `101` and `12321` are palindromes.

The test cases are generated so that the answer always exists and is in the range <code>[2, 2 * 10<sup>8</sup>]</code>.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 6

**Output:** 7

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 8

**Output:** 11

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 13

**Output:** 101

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= n <= 10<sup>8</sup></code>
