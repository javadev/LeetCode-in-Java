3625\. Count Number of Trapezoids II

Hard

You are given a 2D integer array `points` where <code>points[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents the coordinates of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> point on the Cartesian plane.

Return _the number of unique_ _trapezoids_ that can be formed by choosing any four distinct points from `points`.

A **trapezoid** is a convex quadrilateral with **at least one pair** of parallel sides. Two lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** points = [[-3,2],[3,0],[2,3],[3,2],[2,-3]]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

There are two distinct ways to pick four points that form a trapezoid:

*   The points `[-3,2], [2,3], [3,2], [2,-3]` form one trapezoid.
*   The points `[2,3], [3,2], [3,0], [2,-3]` form another trapezoid.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** points = [[0,0],[1,0],[0,1],[2,1]]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

There is only one trapezoid which can be formed.

**Constraints:**

*   `4 <= points.length <= 500`
*   <code>â€“1000 <= x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub> <= 1000</code>
*   All points are pairwise distinct.
