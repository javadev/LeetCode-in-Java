3633\. Earliest Finish Time for Land and Water Rides I

Easy

You are given two categories of theme park attractions: **land rides** and **water rides**.

*   **Land rides**
    *   `landStartTime[i]` – the earliest time the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> land ride can be boarded.
    *   `landDuration[i]` – how long the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> land ride lasts.
*   **Water rides**
    *   `waterStartTime[j]` – the earliest time the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> water ride can be boarded.
    *   `waterDuration[j]` – how long the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> water ride lasts.

A tourist must experience **exactly one** ride from **each** category, in **either order**.

*   A ride may be started at its opening time or **any later moment**.
*   If a ride is started at time `t`, it finishes at time `t + duration`.
*   Immediately after finishing one ride the tourist may board the other (if it is already open) or wait until it opens.

Return the **earliest possible time** at which the tourist can finish both rides.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** landStartTime = [2,8], landDuration = [4,1], waterStartTime = [6], waterDuration = [3]

**Output:** 9

**Explanation:**

*   Plan A (land ride 0 → water ride 0):
    *   Start land ride 0 at time `landStartTime[0] = 2`. Finish at `2 + landDuration[0] = 6`.
    *   Water ride 0 opens at time `waterStartTime[0] = 6`. Start immediately at `6`, finish at `6 + waterDuration[0] = 9`.
*   Plan B (water ride 0 → land ride 1):
    *   Start water ride 0 at time `waterStartTime[0] = 6`. Finish at `6 + waterDuration[0] = 9`.
    *   Land ride 1 opens at `landStartTime[1] = 8`. Start at time `9`, finish at `9 + landDuration[1] = 10`.
*   Plan C (land ride 1 → water ride 0):
    *   Start land ride 1 at time `landStartTime[1] = 8`. Finish at `8 + landDuration[1] = 9`.
    *   Water ride 0 opened at `waterStartTime[0] = 6`. Start at time `9`, finish at `9 + waterDuration[0] = 12`.
*   Plan D (water ride 0 → land ride 0):
    *   Start water ride 0 at time `waterStartTime[0] = 6`. Finish at `6 + waterDuration[0] = 9`.
    *   Land ride 0 opened at `landStartTime[0] = 2`. Start at time `9`, finish at `9 + landDuration[0] = 13`.

Plan A gives the earliest finish time of 9.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** landStartTime = [5], landDuration = [3], waterStartTime = [1], waterDuration = [10]

**Output:** 14

**Explanation:**

*   Plan A (water ride 0 → land ride 0):
    *   Start water ride 0 at time `waterStartTime[0] = 1`. Finish at `1 + waterDuration[0] = 11`.
    *   Land ride 0 opened at `landStartTime[0] = 5`. Start immediately at `11` and finish at `11 + landDuration[0] = 14`.
*   Plan B (land ride 0 → water ride 0):
    *   Start land ride 0 at time `landStartTime[0] = 5`. Finish at `5 + landDuration[0] = 8`.
    *   Water ride 0 opened at `waterStartTime[0] = 1`. Start immediately at `8` and finish at `8 + waterDuration[0] = 18`.

Plan A provides the earliest finish time of 14.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n, m <= 100`
*   `landStartTime.length == landDuration.length == n`
*   `waterStartTime.length == waterDuration.length == m`
*   `1 <= landStartTime[i], landDuration[i], waterStartTime[j], waterDuration[j] <= 1000`
