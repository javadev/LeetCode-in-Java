3660\. Jump Game IX

Medium

You are given an integer array `nums`.

From any index `i`, you can jump to another index `j` under the following rules:

*   Jump to index `j` where `j > i` is allowed only if `nums[j] < nums[i]`.
*   Jump to index `j` where `j < i` is allowed only if `nums[j] > nums[i]`.

For each index `i`, find the **maximum** **value** in `nums` that can be reached by following **any** sequence of valid jumps starting at `i`.

Return an array `ans` where `ans[i]` is the **maximum** **value** reachable starting from index `i`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,1,3]

**Output:** [2,2,3]

**Explanation:**

*   For `i = 0`: No jump increases the value.
*   For `i = 1`: Jump to `j = 0` as `nums[j] = 2` is greater than `nums[i]`.
*   For `i = 2`: Since `nums[2] = 3` is the maximum value in `nums`, no jump increases the value.

Thus, `ans = [2, 2, 3]`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [2,3,1]

**Output:** [3,3,3]

**Explanation:**

*   For `i = 0`: Jump forward to `j = 2` as `nums[j] = 1` is less than `nums[i] = 2`, then from `i = 2` jump to `j = 1` as `nums[j] = 3` is greater than `nums[2]`.
*   For `i = 1`: Since `nums[1] = 3` is the maximum value in `nums`, no jump increases the value.
*   For `i = 2`: Jump to `j = 1` as `nums[j] = 3` is greater than `nums[2] = 1`.

Thus, `ans = [3, 3, 3]`.

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   <code>1 <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>
