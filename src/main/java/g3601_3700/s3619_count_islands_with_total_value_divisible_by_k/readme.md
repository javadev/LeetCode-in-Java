3619\. Count Islands With Total Value Divisible by K

Medium

You are given an `m x n` matrix `grid` and a positive integer `k`. An **island** is a group of **positive** integers (representing land) that are **4-directionally** connected (horizontally or vertically).

The **total value** of an island is the sum of the values of all cells in the island.

Return the number of islands with a total value **divisible by** `k`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = [[0,2,1,0,0],[0,5,0,0,5],[0,0,1,0,0],[0,1,4,7,0],[0,2,0,0,8]], k = 5

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The grid contains four islands. The islands highlighted in blue have a total value that is divisible by 5, while the islands highlighted in red do not.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = [[3,0,3,0], [0,3,0,3], [3,0,3,0]], k = 3

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

The grid contains six islands, each with a total value that is divisible by 3.

**Constraints:**

*   `m == grid.length`
*   `n == grid[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 1000`
*   <code>1 <= m * n <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   <code>0 <= grid[i][j] <= 10<sup>6</sup></code>
*   <code>1 <= k <= 10<sup>6</sup></code>
