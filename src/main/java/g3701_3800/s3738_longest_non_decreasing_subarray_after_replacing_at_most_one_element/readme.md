3738\. Longest Non-Decreasing Subarray After Replacing at Most One Element

Medium

You are given an integer array `nums`.

You are allowed to replace **at most** one element in the array with any other integer value of your choice.

Return the length of the **longest non-decreasing subarray** that can be obtained after performing at most one replacement.

An array is said to be **non-decreasing** if each element is greater than or equal to its previous one (if it exists).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,1,2]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

Replacing `nums[3] = 1` with 3 gives the array [1, 2, 3, 3, 2].

The longest non-decreasing subarray is [1, 2, 3, 3], which has a length of 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [2,2,2,2,2]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:**

All elements in `nums` are equal, so it is already non-decreasing and the entire `nums` forms a subarray of length 5.

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   <code>-10<sup>9</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>
