3319\. K-th Largest Perfect Subtree Size in Binary Tree

Medium

You are given the `root` of a **binary tree** and an integer `k`.

Return an integer denoting the size of the <code>k<sup>th</sup></code> **largest perfect binary** subtree, or `-1` if it doesn't exist.

A **perfect binary tree** is a tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [5,3,6,5,2,5,7,1,8,null,null,6,8], k = 2

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

The roots of the perfect binary subtrees are highlighted in black. Their sizes, in non-increasing order are `[3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.   
 The <code>2<sup>nd</sup></code> largest size is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 1

**Output:** 7

**Explanation:**

The sizes of the perfect binary subtrees in non-increasing order are `[7, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. The size of the largest perfect binary subtree is 7.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = [1,2,3,null,4], k = 3

**Output:** \-1

**Explanation:**

The sizes of the perfect binary subtrees in non-increasing order are `[1, 1]`. There are fewer than 3 perfect binary subtrees.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 2000]`.
*   `1 <= Node.val <= 2000`
*   `1 <= k <= 1024`
