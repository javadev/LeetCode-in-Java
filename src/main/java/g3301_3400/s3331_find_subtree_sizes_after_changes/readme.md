3331\. Find Subtree Sizes After Changes

Medium

You are given a tree rooted at node 0 that consists of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. The tree is represented by an array `parent` of size `n`, where `parent[i]` is the parent of node `i`. Since node 0 is the root, `parent[0] == -1`.

You are also given a string `s` of length `n`, where `s[i]` is the character assigned to node `i`.

We make the following changes on the tree **one** time **simultaneously** for all nodes `x` from `1` to `n - 1`:

*   Find the **closest** node `y` to node `x` such that `y` is an ancestor of `x`, and `s[x] == s[y]`.
*   If node `y` does not exist, do nothing.
*   Otherwise, **remove** the edge between `x` and its current parent and make node `y` the new parent of `x` by adding an edge between them.

Return an array `answer` of size `n` where `answer[i]` is the **size** of the subtree rooted at node `i` in the **final** tree.

A **subtree** of `treeName` is a tree consisting of a node in `treeName` and all of its descendants.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** parent = [-1,0,0,1,1,1], s = "abaabc"

**Output:** [6,3,1,1,1,1]

The parent of node 3 will change from node 1 to node 0.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** parent = [-1,0,4,0,1], s = "abbba"

**Output:** [5,2,1,1,1]

The following changes will happen at the same time:

*   The parent of node 4 will change from node 1 to node 0.
*   The parent of node 2 will change from node 4 to node 1.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == parent.length == s.length`
*   <code>1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   `0 <= parent[i] <= n - 1` for all `i >= 1`.
*   `parent[0] == -1`
*   `parent` represents a valid tree.
*   `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
