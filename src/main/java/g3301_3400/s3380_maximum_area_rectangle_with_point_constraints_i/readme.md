3380\. Maximum Area Rectangle With Point Constraints I

Medium

You are given an array `points` where <code>points[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents the coordinates of a point on an infinite plane.

Your task is to find the **maximum** area of a rectangle that:

*   Can be formed using **four** of these points as its corners.
*   Does **not** contain any other point inside or on its border.
*   Has its edges **parallel** to the axes.

Return the **maximum area** that you can obtain or -1 if no such rectangle is possible.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** points = [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3]]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

**![Example 1 diagram](https://leetcode-in-java.github.io/src/main/java/g3301_3400/s3380_maximum_area_rectangle_with_point_constraints_i/example1.png)**

We can make a rectangle with these 4 points as corners and there is no other point that lies inside or on the border. Hence, the maximum possible area would be 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** points = [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3],[2,2]]

**Output:** \-1

**Explanation:**

**![Example 2 diagram](https://leetcode-in-java.github.io/src/main/java/g3301_3400/s3380_maximum_area_rectangle_with_point_constraints_i/example2.png)**

There is only one rectangle possible is with points `[1,1], [1,3], [3,1]` and `[3,3]` but `[2,2]` will always lie inside it. Hence, returning -1.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** points = [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3],[1,2],[3,2]]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

**![Example 3 diagram](https://leetcode-in-java.github.io/src/main/java/g3301_3400/s3380_maximum_area_rectangle_with_point_constraints_i/example3.png)**

The maximum area rectangle is formed by the points `[1,3], [1,2], [3,2], [3,3]`, which has an area of 2. Additionally, the points `[1,1], [1,2], [3,1], [3,2]` also form a valid rectangle with the same area.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= points.length <= 10`
*   `points[i].length == 2`
*   <code>0 <= x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub> <= 100</code>
*   All the given points are **unique**.
