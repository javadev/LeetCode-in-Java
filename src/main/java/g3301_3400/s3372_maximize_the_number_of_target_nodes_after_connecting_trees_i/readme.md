3372\. Maximize the Number of Target Nodes After Connecting Trees I

Medium

There exist two **undirected** trees with `n` and `m` nodes, with **distinct** labels in ranges `[0, n - 1]` and `[0, m - 1]`, respectively.

You are given two 2D integer arrays `edges1` and `edges2` of lengths `n - 1` and `m - 1`, respectively, where <code>edges1[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the first tree and <code>edges2[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> in the second tree. You are also given an integer `k`.

Node `u` is **target** to node `v` if the number of edges on the path from `u` to `v` is less than or equal to `k`. **Note** that a node is _always_ **target** to itself.

Return an array of `n` integers `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the **maximum** possible number of nodes **target** to node `i` of the first tree if you have to connect one node from the first tree to another node in the second tree.

**Note** that queries are independent from each other. That is, for every query you will remove the added edge before proceeding to the next query.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** edges1 = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[2,4]], edges2 = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[2,7],[1,4],[4,5],[4,6]], k = 2

**Output:** [9,7,9,8,8]

**Explanation:**

*   For `i = 0`, connect node 0 from the first tree to node 0 from the second tree.
*   For `i = 1`, connect node 1 from the first tree to node 0 from the second tree.
*   For `i = 2`, connect node 2 from the first tree to node 4 from the second tree.
*   For `i = 3`, connect node 3 from the first tree to node 4 from the second tree.
*   For `i = 4`, connect node 4 from the first tree to node 4 from the second tree.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** edges1 = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[0,4]], edges2 = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3]], k = 1

**Output:** [6,3,3,3,3]

**Explanation:**

For every `i`, connect node `i` of the first tree with any node of the second tree.

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= n, m <= 1000`
*   `edges1.length == n - 1`
*   `edges2.length == m - 1`
*   `edges1[i].length == edges2[i].length == 2`
*   <code>edges1[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code>
*   <code>0 <= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> < n</code>
*   <code>edges2[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code>
*   <code>0 <= u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub> < m</code>
*   The input is generated such that `edges1` and `edges2` represent valid trees.
*   `0 <= k <= 1000`
