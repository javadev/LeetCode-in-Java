3327\. Check if DFS Strings Are Palindromes

Hard

You are given a tree rooted at node 0, consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. The tree is represented by an array `parent` of size `n`, where `parent[i]` is the parent of node `i`. Since node 0 is the root, `parent[0] == -1`.

You are also given a string `s` of length `n`, where `s[i]` is the character assigned to node `i`.

Consider an empty string `dfsStr`, and define a recursive function `dfs(int x)` that takes a node `x` as a parameter and performs the following steps in order:

*   Iterate over each child `y` of `x` **in increasing order of their numbers**, and call `dfs(y)`.
*   Add the character `s[x]` to the end of the string `dfsStr`.

**Note** that `dfsStr` is shared across all recursive calls of `dfs`.

You need to find a boolean array `answer` of size `n`, where for each index `i` from `0` to `n - 1`, you do the following:

*   Empty the string `dfsStr` and call `dfs(i)`.
*   If the resulting string `dfsStr` is a **palindrome**, then set `answer[i]` to `true`. Otherwise, set `answer[i]` to `false`.

Return the array `answer`.

A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

**Example 1:**

![](https://leetcode-in-java.github.io/src/main/java/g3301_3400/s3327_check_if_dfs_strings_are_palindromes/tree1drawio.png)

**Input:** parent = [-1,0,0,1,1,2], s = "aababa"

**Output:** [true,true,false,true,true,true]

**Explanation:**

*   Calling `dfs(0)` results in the string `dfsStr = "abaaba"`, which is a palindrome.
*   Calling `dfs(1)` results in the string `dfsStr = "aba"`, which is a palindrome.
*   Calling `dfs(2)` results in the string `dfsStr = "ab"`, which is **not** a palindrome.
*   Calling `dfs(3)` results in the string `dfsStr = "a"`, which is a palindrome.
*   Calling `dfs(4)` results in the string `dfsStr = "b"`, which is a palindrome.
*   Calling `dfs(5)` results in the string `dfsStr = "a"`, which is a palindrome.

**Example 2:**

![](https://leetcode-in-java.github.io/src/main/java/g3301_3400/s3327_check_if_dfs_strings_are_palindromes/tree2drawio-1.png)

**Input:** parent = [-1,0,0,0,0], s = "aabcb"

**Output:** [true,true,true,true,true]

**Explanation:**

Every call on `dfs(x)` results in a palindrome string.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == parent.length == s.length`
*   <code>1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   `0 <= parent[i] <= n - 1` for all `i >= 1`.
*   `parent[0] == -1`
*   `parent` represents a valid tree.
*   `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
