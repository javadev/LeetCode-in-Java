3143\. Maximum Points Inside the Square

Medium

You are given a 2D array `points` and a string `s` where, `points[i]` represents the coordinates of point `i`, and `s[i]` represents the **tag** of point `i`.

A **valid** square is a square centered at the origin `(0, 0)`, has edges parallel to the axes, and **does not** contain two points with the same tag.

Return the **maximum** number of points contained in a **valid** square.

Note:

*   A point is considered to be inside the square if it lies on or within the square's boundaries.
*   The side length of the square can be zero.

**Example 1:**

![](3708-tc1.png)

**Input:** points = [[2,2],[-1,-2],[-4,4],[-3,1],[3,-3]], s = "abdca"

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The square of side length 4 covers two points `points[0]` and `points[1]`.

**Example 2:**

![](3708-tc2.png)

**Input:** points = [[1,1],[-2,-2],[-2,2]], s = "abb"

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

The square of side length 2 covers one point, which is `points[0]`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** points = [[1,1],[-1,-1],[2,-2]], s = "ccd"

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

It's impossible to make any valid squares centered at the origin such that it covers only one point among `points[0]` and `points[1]`.

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= s.length, points.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   `points[i].length == 2`
*   <code>-10<sup>9</sup> <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>
*   `s.length == points.length`
*   `points` consists of distinct coordinates.
*   `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
