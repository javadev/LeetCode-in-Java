3190\. Find Minimum Operations to Make All Elements Divisible by Three

Easy

You are given an integer array `nums`. In one operation, you can add or subtract 1 from **any** element of `nums`.

Return the **minimum** number of operations to make all elements of `nums` divisible by 3.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

All array elements can be made divisible by 3 using 3 operations:

*   Subtract 1 from 1.
*   Add 1 to 2.
*   Subtract 1 from 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [3,6,9]

**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 50`
*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 50`
