3180\. Maximum Total Reward Using Operations I

Medium

You are given an integer array `rewardValues` of length `n`, representing the values of rewards.

Initially, your total reward `x` is 0, and all indices are **unmarked**. You are allowed to perform the following operation **any** number of times:

*   Choose an **unmarked** index `i` from the range `[0, n - 1]`.
*   If `rewardValues[i]` is **greater** than your current total reward `x`, then add `rewardValues[i]` to `x` (i.e., `x = x + rewardValues[i]`), and **mark** the index `i`.

Return an integer denoting the **maximum** _total reward_ you can collect by performing the operations optimally.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** rewardValues = [1,1,3,3]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

During the operations, we can choose to mark the indices 0 and 2 in order, and the total reward will be 4, which is the maximum.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** rewardValues = [1,6,4,3,2]

**Output:** 11

**Explanation:**

Mark the indices 0, 2, and 1 in order. The total reward will then be 11, which is the maximum.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= rewardValues.length <= 2000`
*   `1 <= rewardValues[i] <= 2000`
