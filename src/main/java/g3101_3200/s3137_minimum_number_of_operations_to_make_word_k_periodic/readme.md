3137\. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Word K-Periodic

Medium

You are given a string `word` of size `n`, and an integer `k` such that `k` divides `n`.

In one operation, you can pick any two indices `i` and `j`, that are divisible by `k`, then replace the substring of length `k` starting at `i` with the substring of length `k` starting at `j`. That is, replace the substring `word[i..i + k - 1]` with the substring `word[j..j + k - 1]`.

Return _the **minimum** number of operations required to make_ `word` _**k-periodic**_.

We say that `word` is **k-periodic** if there is some string `s` of length `k` such that `word` can be obtained by concatenating `s` an arbitrary number of times. For example, if `word == “ababab”`, then `word` is 2-periodic for `s = "ab"`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** word = "leetcodeleet", k = 4

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

We can obtain a 4-periodic string by picking i = 4 and j = 0. After this operation, word becomes equal to "leetleetleet".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** word = "leetcoleet", k = 2

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

We can obtain a 2-periodic string by applying the operations in the table below.

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= n == word.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   `1 <= k <= word.length`
*   `k` divides `word.length`.
*   `word` consists only of lowercase English letters.
