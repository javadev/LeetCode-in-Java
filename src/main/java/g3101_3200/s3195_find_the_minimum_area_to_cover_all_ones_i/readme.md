3195\. Find the Minimum Area to Cover All Ones I

Medium

You are given a 2D **binary** array `grid`. Find a rectangle with horizontal and vertical sides with the **smallest** area, such that all the 1's in `grid` lie inside this rectangle.

Return the **minimum** possible area of the rectangle.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = [[0,1,0],[1,0,1]]

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

The smallest rectangle has a height of 2 and a width of 3, so it has an area of `2 * 3 = 6`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,0],[0,0]]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

The smallest rectangle has both height and width 1, so its area is `1 * 1 = 1`.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= grid.length, grid[i].length <= 1000`
*   `grid[i][j]` is either 0 or 1.
*   The input is generated such that there is at least one 1 in `grid`.
